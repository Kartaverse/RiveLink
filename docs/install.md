## Vonk Ultra Reactor Atom Package

> Vonk Ultra lets you take your motion graphics workflows to the next level!

Vonk makes it easy to use JSON/CSV files when you need to create data driven graphics.  These external data sources can pass bi-directional event messages to the Rive state machine in your comp. 

This data driven approach allows multiple node branches of RiveLink nodes in a comp to be kept perfectly sync so your .riv based animations playback with precise timing.

> When using RiveLink, it's helpful to also install the "Vonk Ultra" data node toolset from Reactor, too. Select the "Kartaverse/Vonk Ultra" category on the left sidebar. Then click on the ✅ checkbox to the left of the "Vonk Ultra" atom package name to install it.
