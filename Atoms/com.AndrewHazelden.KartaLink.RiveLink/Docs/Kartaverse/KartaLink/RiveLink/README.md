Welcome to the development repo for "RiveLink" â€” a [Rive.app](https://rive.app/) integration plugin for BMD Resolve/Fusion.

With RiveLink you can effortlessly port your existing Rive.app created motion graphics so they can work inside your favorite node based compositing toolset.

Using the toolset is as easy as adding a RiveLink node to your comp. 

With only three nodes in your Fusion comp you are ready to output Rive.app animations to disk that are rendered at real-time FPS.

---

The RiveLink node is implemented as a cross-platform compatible fuse node that uses LuaJIJT FFI shared library linking to the official [rive-cpp](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-cpp) library.

## Usage

Step 1. Add a RiveLink.fuse node to your Fusion composite.

Step 2. Select the RiveLink node in the Nodes view. Then, in the Inspector panel, click on the "Browse" button to select a Rive animation file you would like to place into the document.

Step 3. Connect a Saver or MediaOut node to the RiveLink node's output connection. This will write your Rive renderings to disk, or pass them back to the Resolve Edit page.
